bored of working on (more like bored of thinking of working on) my SeeNatural app

been thinking about self-driving cars a lot

always loved gta 4's driving model

real-time point-to-point driving. how would i...
- get screen or game data?
    - 360 emulator? OBS? Debug output?
- process and interpret data?
    - convert to b&w?
- Send instructions to game? 
    - pyAutoGui? vjoy?
- emulator? virtual controller? What do i even send?
- improve driving?
    - what algorithms? machine learning? AI?

after some research, it seems like the Desktop Duplication API(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/desktop-dup-api) may be a good fit for my needs. btw, DXGI stands for "Direct X Graphics Infrastructure"

or opencv (open com)

OpenCV Object Detection in Games Python Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KecMlLUuiE4 will likely be very useful resource)
