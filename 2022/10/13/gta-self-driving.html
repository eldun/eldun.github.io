<p>bored of working on (more like bored of thinking of working on) my SeeNatural app</p>

<p>been thinking about self-driving cars a lot</p>

<p>always loved gta 4’s driving model</p>

<p>real-time point-to-point driving. how would i…</p>
<ul>
  <li>get screen or game data?
    <ul>
      <li>360 emulator? OBS? Debug output?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>process and interpret data?
    <ul>
      <li>convert to b&amp;w?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Send instructions to game?
    <ul>
      <li>pyAutoGui? vjoy?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>emulator? virtual controller? What do i even send?</li>
  <li>improve driving?
    <ul>
      <li>what algorithms? machine learning? AI?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>after some research, it seems like the Desktop Duplication API(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/desktop-dup-api) may be a good fit for my needs. btw, DXGI stands for “Direct X Graphics Infrastructure”</p>

<p>or opencv (open com)</p>

<p>OpenCV Object Detection in Games Python Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KecMlLUuiE4 will likely be very useful resource)</p>
