    I started this path tracer months ago, and only started this blog in late May. The version of Shirley's book that I used is from some time in 2018 (Version 1.54), and I have found that there is a recently updated version (3.1.2) on [his website](https://raytracing.github.io/) from June 6th, 2020! I also supplemented Shirley's book with [Victor Li's posts on the subject](http://viclw17.github.io/tag/#/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20One%20Weekend). As such, there may be differences in implementation compared to the most recent version of Ray Tracing in One Weekend. <br><br>I am trying to keep things easy-to-follow, mostly sticking with my original code and only changing or adding what I deem to be necessary for readability, clarity, or image rendering purposes. If you are reading this to build your own ray tracer, I highly recommend Shirley's book as a main source.
